This program continuously writes random java classes using dictionaries of java keywords, operators, symbols, random strings, random numbers. The application needs direction.
Current objective(s):
  - Learn compiling code with a long length. (Pretty much pointless objective, I know.)

Rules being followed are:
  - Cannot place variable name next to another variable name.

The next step in the program will be to define some sort of problem for it to solve, and a way to test source code to see if it is getting closer to solving the problem.
